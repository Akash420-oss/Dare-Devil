# What dark<-💀->secret lurks within??
This game is a guessing game, but it primarily involves addressing elements from your RAM. I designed it for Reverse Engineers. You start with 99 souls, but you can choose to wager more if you dare. The game has two levels: Sinister and Inferno. When you select your level, the devil..😈 will give you a number to identify its memory address. If you choose the wrong address, you'll lose souls or risk crashing your system due to hidden exploits...☣️

## Cursed Materials
This infernal creation wrought from the dark arts of C language and the arcane spells of shell scripting...
