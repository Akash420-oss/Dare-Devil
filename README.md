# What dark<-💀->secret lurks within??
This game is a guessing game, but it primarily involves addressing elements from your RAM. I designed it for Reverse Engineers. You start with 99 souls, but you can choose to wager more if you dare. The game has two levels: Sinister and Inferno. When you select your level, the devil..😈 will give you a number to identify its memory address. If you choose the wrong address, you'll lose souls or risk crashing your system due to hidden exploits...☣️

## Cursed Materials
This infernal creation wrought from the dark arts of C language and the arcane spells of shell scripting...
* C
* Shell Scripting

# Awakening the Shadows
I am leading you through the sinister labyrinth of this game...
## Dark Desires..😈
To venture into this twisted game, you must first summon these dark tools:
* VMware or VirtualBox –> Your gateway to the virtual realm...
* Linux OS –> The cursed operating system that will run this infernal game...
## Ritual of unholy Embodiment
* First clone the cursed repository of chaos..
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Akash420-oss/Dare-Devil
  ```
* Now traverse into the abyssal directory...
  ```
  cd Dare-Devil
  ```
* Invoke the arcane powers of gcc to conjure the game's dark compilation..
  ```
  gcc -o dare_devil dare_devil.c -w
  ```
* Invoke its dark powers with the authority of a root user...
  ```
  chmod +x dare_devil && ./dare_devil
  ```
## Omnious..⚠️
* Dare to embark on this adventure at your own discretion...❗
* For your safety, avoid playing this game on your primary Linux OS...🚫
* Utilize VMware or VirtualBox for a safer experience...✔️
* Remember, you might have important documents that could be at risk..⚠️
